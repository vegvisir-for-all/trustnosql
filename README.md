TrustNoSql is a Laravel role/permission manager for MongoDB-based applications. It supports roles, permissions, and teams, provides a complex way of determining ownage (grabbing) of objects, and offers a nice CLI for your convenience.
TrustNoSql is built atop a great [jenssegers/laravel-mongodb](https://github.com/jenssegers/Laravel-MongoDB) package, and it's inspired by [Laratrust](https://github.com/santigarcor/laratrust). 

Documentation
-------------

Since TrustNoSql is in a heavy development phase, the documentation is not ready yet. It's being written at the time being :) It would be available at [https://trustnosql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://trustnosql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Development
-----------

TrustNoSql is in the alpha state. Base functionalities are already written, however, no tests have been conducted yet. Therefore, we can take no responsibility for any damage it does if you use TrustNoSql in your projects.
