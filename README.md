TrustNoSql
==========

TrustNoSql is a Laravel role/permission manager for MongoDB-based applications. It supports roles, permissions, and teams, provides a complex way of determining ownage (grabbing) of objects, and offers a nice CLI for your convenience.
TrustNoSql is built atop a great jenssegers/mongodb package, and it's inspired by Laratrust.
