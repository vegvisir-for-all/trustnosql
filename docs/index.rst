What is TrustNoSql
##################
    
TrustNoSql is a Laravel (>=5.3) role/permission manager for MongoDB-based applications. It supports roles, permissions, and teams, provides a complex way of determining ownage (grabbing) of objects, and offers a nice CLI for your convenience. TrustNoSql is built atop a great `jenssegers/laravel-mongodb <https://github.com/jenssegers/laravel-mongodb>`_ package, and it's inspired by `Laratrust <https://github.com/santigarcor/laratrust>`_.

**TrustNoSql is in the development phase. We can take no responsibility for any damage it creates when used in production projects. However, we hope to publish a stable version soon.**
